President: Franklin D. Roosevelt
<p>To the Congress:</p>

<p>On the morning of December eleventh, the Government of Germany, pursuing its course of world conquest, declared war against the United States.</p>

<p>The long known and the long expected has thus taken place. The forces endeavoring to enslave the entire world now are moving toward this hemisphere.</p>

<p>Never before has there been a greater challenge to life, liberty, and civilization.</p>

<p>Delay invites greater danger. Rapid and united effort by all of the peoples of the world who are determined to remain free will insure a world victory of the forces of justice and of righteousness over the forces of savagery and of barbarism.</p>

<p>Italy also has declared war against the United States.</p>

<p>I therefore request the Congress to recognize a state of war between the United States and Germany, and between the United States and Italy.</p>
